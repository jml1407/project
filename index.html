<h3>Origins</h3>   
Renewd began in a small workshop in Portland, Oregon, where Maya, a fashion designer passionate about sustainability, and Sam, an environmental scientist, combined their skills to tackle the growing issue of textile waste. Inspired by the concept of circular fashion, they started by sourcing discarded fabrics and transforming them into stylish, high-quality basics, including t-shirts, hoodies, and tote bags. Their early products were handmade, each piece a testament to craftsmanship and sustainability.

<h3>Early Days</h3>
In its first year, Renewd sold limited collections at local markets and through a small online store. Their signature product, a recycled cotton hoodie, quickly gained attention for its comfort and eco-friendly production.

<h3>Growth and Impact</h3>
Over the years, Renewd expanded its range to include upcycled denim, accessories, and outerwear, all made from post-consumer and industrial waste. Collaborations with ethical supply chains and innovative recycling technologies allowed the company to scale while maintaining their commitment to sustainability. By 2022, Renewd had launched international shipping and partnered with several environmental organizations, reinforcing its mission to reduce fashion's ecological footprint.

Today, Renewd is more than a brand—it’s a movement promoting conscious consumption, proving that fashion can be both stylish and sustainable. Their motto, "Renew the Future," reflects their ongoing commitment to creating a better world, one garment at a time.
